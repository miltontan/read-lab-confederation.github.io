We have been building a database called [Staphopia](http://www.staphopia.com) to assemble and call SNPs in public *S. aureus* whole genome sequencing projects

We recently published [an analysis](https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/nyc-subway-anthrax-study/) on the metagenomic data supporting the presence of anthrax in NY subway system

We used the R Shiny package to create an [interactive page](https://tread.shinyapps.io/VISA-shiny/) to explore the interaction of phenotype and genotype in vancomycin intermediate *S. aureus* (VISA) strains.

I developed a [bioinformatics class](https://github.com/IBS574/metagenome_assignment/blob/master/metagenomic_exercise.md) for geneticists using real metagenomics data.
