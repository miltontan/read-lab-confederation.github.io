##Timothy D. Read Ph. D

I am an Associate Professor of Medicine at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia, with a primary appointment in the Division of Infectious Diseases and a secondary in the Department of Human Genetics.  I am a member of two Emory graduate programs: Population Biology, Ecology and Evolution and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics.

My research centers on genomics of infectious diseases, focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on bacterial pathogens *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Staphylococcus aureus*.  I use comparative approaches to understand evolution of traits such as virulence and antibiotic resistance phenotypes and develop countermeasures and diagnostics.  As a microbial geneticist by training I have a long-standing fascination with the movement of genes between bacteria by lateral gene transfer.  As someone who loves genetics in the broadest sense, I also am involved in several projects analyzing microbiome data, developing new bioinformatics tools and working with genomes of plants and vertebrate species.  I am collaborating with the Georgia Aquarium to sequence the [genome of the whale shark, *Rhincodon typus*](https://peerj.com/preprints/837/).
My work is made possible by a tremendous team of talented people and the awesome facilities at Emory.  Interactions with Emory's diverse academic community often lead to exciting new research opportunities.
