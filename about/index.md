title: About the Read Laboratory 
---

I am an Associate Professor of Medicine at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia, with a primary appointment in the Division of Infectious Diseases and a secondary in the Department of Human Genetics.  I am a member of two Emory graduate programs: Population Biology, Ecology and Evolution and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics.
My research centers on genomics of infectious diseases, focusing on bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis.  I use comparative approaches to understand evolution of traits such as virulence and antibiotic resistance phenotypes and develop countermeasures and diagnostics.  As a microbial geneticist by training I have a long-standing fascination with the movement of genes between bacteria by lateral gene transfer.  As someone who loves genetics in the broadest sense, I also am involved in several projects analyzing microbiome data, developing new bioinformatics tools and working with genomes of plants and vertebrate species.
My work is made possible by a tremendous team of talented people and the awesome facilities at Emory.  Interactions with Emory's diverse academic community often lead to exciting new research opportunities.  Please feel free to contact myself or members of my group to find out more about what we do.
